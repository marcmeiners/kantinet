# kantinet.ch

In the context of my Swiss Matura Paper, I created a textbook exchange named "kantinet.ch". The paper (german) can be found [HERE](kantinet.pdf).
- A tool was created in the form of a website that should allow highschool pupils from Zurich to sell textbooks that they no longer need and to purchase used copies.
- The website is fully interactive and automated: it has a registration and login solution, as well as a user-friendly dashboard where books and user data can be managed
- In the books overview, the books available for sale can be viewed, filtered and finally bought
- The book registration process is supplemented by an interface to an external platform, so that a lot of book information can already be called up automatically using the ISBN number and does not have to be entered manually by the seller
- The verification of the school e-mail address and a sophisticated reactivation system also ensure that only people are registered on the platform who are currently attending or have recently attended a Zurich canton school
- Precautions have been taken to protect against any attacks on the website, which not only check the form and length of the user's input, but also whether it contains program code that could be smuggled in via forms, for example

> I've created this website at the age of 18 from scratch, without using any frameworks and with very limited knowledge of Web Development.
